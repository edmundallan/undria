Yes, this plugin works really fine with WordPress 4.5.2!
It also works great with WP 4.3 - and also should with WP 4.2 - but we only tested extensively with WP 4.4 and 4.3. So you always should run the latest WordPress version for a lot of reasons.

= How do I use the grid that I just created =
Go to Dashboard -> Elements. You will see that there is a ‘short-code’ column.
